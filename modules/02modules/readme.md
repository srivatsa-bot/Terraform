providers are 1-1 mapping of the cloud provider api

but suppose you want to make vpc you need to paste a lot of code

so modules are abstractions writter over already abstracted hcl, to simply the process

get modules code from ```terraform``` website

perform init to downlaod the dependicies for module
```sh
terraform inti
```
Do ```terraform apply``` to intilize the resources
